# Snowball Project

This is a collaborative school project between Taust and Koko-Mx. 
 
 

## Basic Rundown of Our Concept

### How to Get Points:
every time you get a letter right by guessing, plus 1 point per letter. If you complete a word, plus 3 points and the player receives a snowball   

### How to Lose Points:
every time you get a letter wrong, minus one point, also add a part on the snowman. (he has 7 parts) if the snowman is completed lose half your points, and restart the word and snowman. 

### What is a Snowball: 
snowballs are used to remove a part off of your snowman, and add one for the enemys. 

### Timers:
there will be a seperate timer for both players (like in chess). once your timer reaches 0 you no longer can guess, or have a snowball thrown at you. once both timers are 0 end the game. whoever has the most points wins. 

### Extra rules:
if you guess a letter that you already guessed, it becomes wrong and adds a snowman peice.
